# This script lists the ip addresses you are currently using.
# If I were super-elitist, I could just say the code below is the 
# documentation.  That's not me.  The piping sequence is long and scary.
#
# 1) query ip addr for info on local networking
# 2) only get the lines containing inet
# 3) exclude the line that has the local loopback
# 4) get rid of leading white space
# 5) discard the broadcast address
# 6) discard the netmask
# 7) print only the fifth and second fields, in that order
#
# This script also accepts one switch of either:
#   -a   List all (internal and public) IP addresses
#   -i   List only internal IP addresses
#   -p   List only public IP address
